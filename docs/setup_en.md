# Setup Guide for Twilight Princess Archipelago

Welcome to Twilight Princess Archipelago! This guide will help you set up the randomizer and play your first multiworld.
Whether playing, generating, or hosting an Archipelago room with Twilight Princess, you must follow a few simple steps to
get started.

Unfortunately, Mac OS is not officially supported at this time.

## Requirements

You'll need the following components to be able to play/generate with Twilight Princess:

- Install [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) v0.6.1 or higher.\
   **Make sure to install the Generator if you intend to generate multiworlds.**
- The latest version of the [Twilight Princess APWorld](https://github.com/WritingHusky/twilight_princess/releases/latest).

### If you're playing Twilight Princess, you'll also need:

- Install [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/download/).\
   **We recommend using the latest release.**
- A legaly obtained Twilight Princess ISO.

If you intend to play under Linux, you will need to consider the following information.

- Grab the `tar.gz` version of Archipelago, not the `AppImage`. The file name should be similar to the following on the
  release page: `Archipelago_X.X.X_linux-x86_64.tar.gz`.
- For Dolphin, you can use the flatpak package
  [available on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu).

## Installation

All users should follow these steps:

1. Unzip the downloaded Twilight Princess APWorld zip file.
2. Double-click the `twilight_princess.apworld` file. It should automatically install the APWorld after a little while. You will get a
   little dialog window telling you it has been installed successfully. \* Alternatively, copy the `twilight_princess.apworld` to your Archipelago installation's `custom_worlds` folder (Windows default
   to: `%programdata%/Archipelago`).

### Note: If you have a previous version of the apworld you will need to remove it.

If you're playing Twilight Princess, you must also download the REL loader from https://tprandomizer.com/downloads/ and place it in the save data of dolphin (See [Placing the files](https://github.com/WritingHusky/Twilight_Princess_apworld/blob/main/docs/setup_en.md#Placing-the-files)).

Note: If you started the Game before placing the Files in the Folder, you might have a Vanilla Save called `01-GZ2E-gczelda2.gci` which needs to be removed to make the `REL Loader v2` show up in the 3rd save slot in game.

## Setting Up a YAML

All players playing Twilight Princess must provide the room host with a YAML file containing the settings for their world.
The TP APWorld download includes a sample YAML file for Twilight Princess. The comments in that file explain each
setting's function.

Once you're happy with your settings, provide the room host with your YAML file and proceed to the next step.

## Generating a Multiworld

If you're generating a multiworld game that includes Twilight Princess, you'll need to do so locally as the online
generator does not yet support Twilight Princess. Follow these steps to generate a multiworld:

1. Gather all player's YAMLs. Place these YAMLs into the `Players` folder of your Archipelago installation. If the
   folder does not exist, then it must be created manually. The files here should not be compressed.
2. Modify any local host settings for generation, as desired.
3. Run `ArchipelagoGenerate.exe` (without `.exe` on Linux) or click `Generate` in the launcher. The generation output
   is placed in the `output` folder (usually named something like `AP_XXXXX.zip`). \* Please note that if any player in the game you want to generate plays a game that needs a ROM file to generate,
   you will need the corresponding ROM files. A ROM file is not required for Twilight Princess at this stage.
4. Unzip the `AP_XXXXX.zip` file. It should include a `.aptp` file for each player in the room playing Twilight Princess.
   Each file will be named `AP_XXXXX_P#_<name>.aptp`, where `#` corresponds to that player's slot number and `<name>` is
   their slot (player) name. The `.aptp` is used to create a seed file. This will be explained shortly.
5. In the next section, use the archive file `AP_XXXXX.zip` to host a room or provide it to the room host.

## Hosting a Room

If you're generating the multiworld, follow the instructions in the previous section. Once you have the zip file
corresponding to your multiworld, follow
[these steps](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en#hosting-an-archipelago-server) to host a room. Follow
the instructions for hosting on the website from a locally generated game or on a local machine.

## Generating a Seed File

In order to connect to a room you will need the seed file for the world.
You will need the `.aptp` file created during generation. If your multiworld is hosted on a Archipelago webserver you can download the patch from there or ask the host for your file.

1. Visit https://ap.tprandomizer.com/
2. Choose to randomize cosmetics / audio as you wish.
3. Upload `.aptp` file to the "AP File Upload" Section.
4. Press "Get Download Link" and download the file.
5. If you dont yet have the REL loader downloaded, download it at the bottom of the page (Note that it is region specific i.e. NA, PAL, and JP).

If you would like to patch your game instead of using a seed, before downloading, upload your ISO and select Patch ISO. Then you can place the patched ISO wherever your vanilla ISO is.

## Placing the files

You should now have a seed and REL Loader file.

1. Ensure that GCI Folder is the selected method. You can check this by going to 'Options > Configuration > Gamecube > Device Settings' Slot A should be selected as GCI Folder.
    - Note: If you see a folder path under the Slot A drop down that is the folder you should put the file in.
2. Now you will want to find where your dolphin is installed. By deafualt this is in `C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Roaming\Dolphin Emulator`
3. Travse to `Dolphin Emulator\GC\USA\Card A` and place your files there.
4. If you see a file named `01-GZ2E-gczelda2.gci` that is your vanilla save data. You will need to remove / delete it.

## Connecting to a Room

Before connecting make sure you have created and placed your seed file.

Once you do, follow these steps to connect to the room:

1. Open Dolphin and use it to open Twilight Princess. (Ensure `Enable Emulated Memory Size Override` is disabled. See troubleshooting for more details)
2. Start the REL loader save file and select APTest as the seed you want to use.
   The game will restart if you press 'R + Z' a console will pop up and it should say "Archipelego Randomizer - v1.3" at the top
3. Start a new save file and leave links name as default, it will change when you begin.
4. Start `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe` (without `.exe` on Linux) and choose `Twilight Princess Client`, which will open the
   text client. It should automatically connect to Dolphin.
5. You will see a message saying "Randomizer loaded .... Using Seed ID [Seed name] that is the name of the current seed.
6. Connect to the room by entering the server name and port number at the top and pressing `Connect`. For rooms hosted
   on the website, this will be `archipelago.gg:<port>`, where `<port>` is the port number. If a game is hosted from the
   `ArchipelagoServer.exe` (without `.exe` on Linux), this will default to `38281` but may be changed in the `host.yaml`.
7. If the incorrect seed was loaded a message will appear with the name of the seed you are supossed to load.

## PopTracker

There's a working PopTracker pack for TP at: https://github.com/Kizugaya/TPRAP_poptracker/releases/latest <br/>
You will need to install PopTracker itself at: https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases/latest <br/>
If you have any issues with it, please DM `☆☬𝓚𝓲𝓻𝓲𝓽𝓸☬☆`/`kizugaya` on Discord or ping him in the [#twilight-princess](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1369050080887312506) channel in the [Archipelago Discord](https://discord.gg/archipelago). You can also open an Issue on GitHub on his Pack.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that you are running version v0.6.7 or higher of Archipelago, and the latest version of the world.
- If you do not see the client in the launcher, ensure the `Twilight Princess.apworld` file is in the correct folder (the
  `custom_worlds` folder of your Archipelago installation).
- If the client says that seed version and client version do not match, it is recomended regenerate the seed with the current version.
  Differences in version can cause bugs which may make it unplayable.
- If the client throws an error along the lines of "could not read memory at < some-number >", dolphin has been disconnected.
  It should automaticly reconnect, so ensure that dolphin is open and running
- Ensure that you do not have any Dolphin cheats or codes enabled. Some cheats or codes can unexpectedly interfere with
  emulation and make troubleshooting errors difficult.
- If Dolphin is not connecting, ensure that `Enable Emulated Memory Size Override` in Dolphin (under `Options` >
  `Configuration` > `Advanced`) is **disabled**.
- If you run with a custom GC boot menu, you'll need to skip it by going to `Options` > `Configuration` > `GameCube`
  and checking `Skip Main Menu`.
- If Dolphin does load the RELoader save file and has a popup saying something like "Save file cannot be loaded",
  There may be a normal save file in your dolphin save folder, this will need to be removed in order for the randomizer to load.
- If you have killed Ganon but the world has not been realesed. Ensure that the host settings allows player releases.
  Check that the Archipelego Randomizer is loaded by bringing up the console window.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Setup

**Q:** "I can't find my GCI folder!" / "What do I do with the MemoryCardA.raw file?"<br/>
**A:** In Dolphin settings, under the GC tab, please set Slot A to 'GCI Folder'; once you do, press the [...] button to set/confirm the directory for it if you don't want to use the default one (default ends in `Card A`).

**Q:** "What goes in the GCI folder?"<br/>
**A:** `GZ2E01_REL_Loader_v2.gci` and the generated seed file.

**Q:** "What do I do with the APTP patch file?"<br/>
**A:** Go to the [patching website](https://ap.tprandomizer.com) and upload the file to get a custom seed to use.

**Q:** "I can't connect, the client says 'Invalid Slot'!"<br/>
**A:** Make sure you have the correct seed loaded. In the client should be a message with what seed to load.

### In-Game

**Q:** "I'm getting items twice!"<br/>
**A:** The REL Loader file must only be run **once** per Dolphin session. Running more than once can cause you to receive items multiple times.

**Q:** "I received an item but never got it!"<br/>
**A:** If it is an important item (Not a ruppe or ammo), wait a few seconds on the ground and you will recieve the item.

**Q:** "I'm stuck in the Darknut room in Temple of Time!"<br/>
**A:** This is because the of the Open Door of Time setting. If you save and quit it will bring you to start of the Dungeon. Midna can bring you back to Links house at anytime if that is needed.

**Q:** "I'm stuck in the Gerudo Desert and don't have the Shadow Crystal to warp out!"<br/>
**A:** Same Answer as above: save and quit to get back to Lake Hylia or Midna to links house

**Q:** "How do I move the statue in the basement of the Kakariko hut?"<br/>
**A:** You don't. If skip_city_in_the_sky_entrance: false, then you need seven Progressive Sky Books (the book itself and then six letters) before CitS is logically accessible.

### PopTracker (Under devlopment for v0.4.0 compatibilty)

**Q:** "What are these blue squares?"<br/>
**A:** For Twilight Princess's Poptracker, the blue squares indicate howling stone locations. There is a blue square both at the howling stone itself and at the golden wolf that howling stone spawns. The golden wolf will not be shown as logically-available until the howling stone is activated.

**Q:** "Why is a check marked red when I can get it?"<br/>
**A:** If you are in a dungeon, the answer is probably key logic; essentially, logic has to assume you have used small keys on every other accessible locked door first, to ensure that you can't lock yourself out of a necessary progression item. If you are not in a dungeon, or you're absolutely sure key logic isn't the problem here, then please tell us about it!

**Q:** "Why does the tracker only auto-tab _sometimes_?"<br/>
**A:** The Twilight Princess APworld can only track which "region" you're in to send to Poptracker. For some places, like Ordona Province, or dungeons, there's only one map for that region anyway, and Poptracker is able to auto-tab to that map. For the major regions (Faron, Eldin, and Lanaryu), as there are multiple possible maps, Poptracker cannot tell which one you're in specifically. For the partial auto-tabbing (the default), this means it does not shift maps at all. If you instead set it to full auto-tabbing, then entering any of these regions will set Poptracker to switch to the full map.
